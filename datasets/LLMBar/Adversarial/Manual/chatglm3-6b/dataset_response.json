Here are the 10 insignificant factors to consider:\n\n1. Cooking temperature: Cooking food at the right temperature is the first rule of the food safety system. The right cooking temperature kills even the most poisonous bacteria in the food products and prevents any foodborne illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed a temperature range for different food products.\n\n2. COVID-19 precautions: All staff involved in handling food products should have COVID vaccine certification. It is important to make masks mandatory in the COVID era and ask staff to wear hand gloves, face shields and kitchen caps while in the kitchen to ensure food protection.\n\n3. Food safety regulations: Food safety regulations are laws designed to protect consumers from the risk of illness caused by eating unsafe foods. The U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) publishes guidelines for food manufacturers to follow when producing food, while the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publishes guidelines for restaurants. There is also a high standard of safety set forth by the U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\n4. Water quality: Make sure the water you use for soaking food products and cooking meets the drinking water safety standards. Contaminated water is a major source of E-coli and Campylobacter, which can cause severe foodborne illness. It is recommended to have floor drains throughout the kitchen area for easy and safe disposal of liquid waste.\n\n5. Hygienic design: Sanitary operational performance and hygienic design of maintenance enclosures are important factors to consider. Hygienic compatibility with other plant systems and validating cleaning and sanitizing protocols are also important.\n\n6. Pest control: Pest control plays an important part in food safety. Pests that are a risk to food safety must be controlled.\n\n7. Food storage: A store room for keeping raw materials and food products like grains and cereals is a must-have in any food establishment. If dealing primarily in frozen foods, then it is important to have a properly designed cold storage that meets your business needs.\n\n8. Foreign objects: Establish food safety processes that hinder foreign objects, such as plastics or glass, from entering your food products.\n\n9. Employee training: Train your employees on food safety so that they always know how to handle food properly to protect your customers. Educate staff on the ingredients of your food products, such as allergens, for example, in case they need to inform your customers.\n\n10. Internal audits: Conduct regular internal audits to enforce that all food safety processes are followed.", "output_2": "1. The color of the chef's hat.\n2. The number of forks at the table.\n3.

The rise of Art Nouveau in the late 19th century also had a significant impact on wallpaper and fabric design, with its emphasis on organic forms and curvilinear shapes.\n\nIn the United States, the Arts and Crafts movement also had a strong influence on surface pattern design, as did the emergence of the Art Deco style in the 1920s and 30s. American designers were also influenced by the bold, graphic patterns of African textiles and the geometric motifs of Native American art.\n\nIn the 20th century, modernist designers like Bauhaus and De Stijl had a significant impact on surface pattern design, with their emphasis on clean lines, geometric forms, and minimalism. In the latter half of the century, pop art and psychedelic art also had a significant influence on pattern design.\n\nToday, surface pattern design is a thriving field with a wide range of styles and influences, from traditional floral patterns to abstract geometric designs.

Imagine you're a little seed in the ground, and you need sunshine, water, and some good soil to grow into a big, strong plant. Just like you need these things to grow, the Earth needs certain things to create different types of water.\n\nFirst, the sun shines down on the Earth and heats it up. This makes the Earth warm, and when it's warm, it creates something called \"evaporation.\" That's when water turns into a gas and goes up into the sky.\n\nThen, the warm, moist air rises and cools down. When it cools down, the water turns back into little drops and forms clouds. Sometimes the clouds get really big and heavy, and when they do, they release all the water back down to the Earth in the form of rain or snow.\n\nFinally, the water goes back into the ground or into rivers and lakes, and the whole process starts all over again! It's like a big circle, or a cycle, that happens over and over again to create different types of weather like sunshine, rain, snow, and everything in between.", "output_2": "The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle or the hydrological cycle, is a biogeochemical cycle that describes the continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of the Earth. The mass of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time but the partitioning of the water into the major reservoirs of ice, fresh water, saline water (salt water) and atmospheric water is variable depending on a wide range of climatic variables. The water moves from one reservoir to another, such as from river to ocean, or from the ocean to the atmosphere, by the physical processes of evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, surface runoff, and subsurface flow. In doing so, the water goes through different forms: liquid, solid (ice) and vapor. The ocean plays a key role in the water cycle as it is the source of 86% of global evaporation.\n\nThe water cycle involves the exchange of energy, which leads to temperature changes. When water evaporates, it takes up energy from its surroundings and cools the environment. When it condenses, it releases energy and warms the environment. These heat exchanges influence climate.\n\nThe evaporative phase of the cycle purifies water which then replenishes the land with freshwater. The flow of liquid water and ice transports minerals across the globe. It is also involved in reshaping the geological features of the Earth, through processes including erosion and sedimentation. The water cycle is also essential for the maintenance of most life and ecosystems on the planet.", "label": 1, "response_judge": " \n 1.

Determine what industry you want to work in, what types of roles you're looking for, your ideal salary range, and what type of company you want to work at.\n\n2. Diversify where you look: There are a lot of resources for finding jobs, especially online. There are job search sites that have every type of job, sites that focus on one industry, and employer careers pages.\n\n3. Build skills while you wait: Sometimes the job searching process is time-consuming, and you may find yourself waiting to hear from employers at various stages of the process. While you should continue applying as you wait, you can also use that time to build the skills you might need to get your preferred job. This might mean adding a new skill or enhancing a skill you already have.\n\n4. Customize your application materials: You are likely to get better results if you tailor each cover letter and resume to the individual jobs you apply for. It's still important to have a basic cover letter and resume, but you can adjust those to fit the job description for what you're applying to.\n\n5. Use social media to find jobs: You can use many social media sites in your job search. Most businesses have some sort of social media presence, even if they're not on every platform, and you can follow companies you identified as a good fit for you on those platforms.\n\n6. Research potential employers: Research companies in the industry you want to work in and how what they offer aligns with what you want in an employer.\n\n7.
